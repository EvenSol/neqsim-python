# NeqSim Python
NeqSim Python is a Python interface to the [NeqSim Java library](https://github.com/equinor/neqsim) for estimation of fluid behavior and process design for oil and gas production. NeqSim Python toolboxes (eg. thermoTools and processTools) are implemented to streamline use of neqsim in Python. Examples of use are given in jupyter workbooks.

## Releases

## Getting Started
See the [NeqSim Python Wiki](/wiki) for how to use NeqSim Python via PYthon or in Jupyter notebooks.

### Prerequisites
The python package py4j is used to connect python and java. The needed Python packages are listed on the [NeqSim Python dependencies page](https://github.com/equinor/neqsimpython/network/dependencies). 

### Initial setup
The NeqSim Python package is downloaded by cloning the library to your local computer (alternatively fork it to your private reprository). The following commands are dependent on a local installation of [GIT](https://git-scm.com/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/equinor/neqsimpython.git
cd neqsimpython
```
